# Compilers
## Introduction
Compilers are programs that operate on some sort of human-readable text that conforms to a particular set of predefined rules (known as a computer language) and transform them into a set of instructions that can be operated on by a computer.  Compilers are the first (but often not the only) program in the process of preparing code written by programmers into machine-level instructions that can be understood by a computer.  A working compiler is often itself a two-step process, with a lexing component (or lexer) that groups and categorizes individual textual items in the source code and a parsing components (or parser) that checks the lexer's output against the language's grammar to ensure that the input provided by the programmer correctly follows the syntax of the language so that the semantic intent of the programmer can be systematically translated into machine code by other later components in the chain.
